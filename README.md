# SC-Photo-Service

This is a photo service intended for [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete). It allows to upload photos during a survey, which are taken to help resolving an OpenStreetMap note. This project exists because of [StreetComplete Issue 1161](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/1161).


## Objectives

In order to minimize the risk of abuse, the photo service only serves photos associated to OpenStreetMap notes.

Design decisions (e.g. programming language and repository structure) are based on the requirements imposed by the intended hosting infrastructure.
